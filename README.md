# Coding Assignment

The goal is to demonstrate your ability to build features and your coding style. Given the limited time, you will have to decide what to prioritize, balancing clean code and completing the assignment.

The app is small but one could easily spend many days working on it: creating a beautiful UI, testing every method or carefully optimizing each line of code. Do as much as you can in two hours and share the results.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install

# run app
npm run start

# run tests
npm run test
```

## Tasks managing application

* The app has two screens: the list screen and the details screen. Use the Angular router to manage the
  transitions between them.
* The ngrx is used to manage the state.
